# Design Notes
Notes for how different elements should be designed.

## Gameplay
### Combat
- Blocking can be done at any time, but parries are frame-perfect
- Blocking stops attacking, but greatly reduces damage
    - Small but clear round shield effect
    - No extra SFX or flash
- Parry stuns opponent, opens counterattack with more damage
    - Slow-motion
    - Bright flash
    - Awesome SFX
    - Extra screenshake

# Visuals
- Coherent colours
- High contrast for higher impact, lower for less important details
- Simple, contrasting colours
- Pixel art characters, background, and icons
- GPU particles (non-pixelated)
- Heavy use of tweening & smooth animations
- Don't overcrowd the screen, but don't leave it empty
- Buildup with intensity
### Characters
- Simple colour palette, high-contrast
- Stands out from background
- Recognizable silhoutte

## Audio
### SFX
- Different effects taking up different frequency sections
- Sounds enhance feel and impact
- "Chiptune" SFX
### Music
- Fast but not overwhelming
- Breakcore-ish mixed with metal
- Chiptune with [DefleMask](https://www.deflemask.com/)
- Don't drown out SFX
